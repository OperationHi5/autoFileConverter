I wrote this script in Python to walk through a directory of video files and use Handbrake CLI for compressing them/converting them to a different file type in order to maximize space on a hard drive while keeping visual quality to an acceptable level.

When you run the script, you will be prompted to input the name of a directory for the program to search through. It scans the entire directory and adds every file that matches the criteria to a list to be processed by Handbrake.
